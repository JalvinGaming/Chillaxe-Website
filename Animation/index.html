        <h1>Animation</h1>
        <p>
            I am moderately experienced in Blender animation,
            and especially in roller coasters, as they're my
            special interest. One thing that has always
            bugged me in animated movies is the lack of
            realism of the roller coasters. Now, you could
            say I'm being petty, and I'd agree with you, but
            still. It has bugged me. I've always strived to
            make roller coasters in animated movies more
            realistic, so I made the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChillaxeCoasters">Chillaxe Coasters</a>
            channel. This channel is dedicated to me making
            roller coasters of any type into Blender and
            posting it online.
