            MapMaker is a comprehensive fictional cartography tool
            currently in development. It uses the Godot game engine,
            and it is in very early development (you can't even select).
            The software works with paths and polygons called lines, and
            attributes called tags, a way to set the style and function
            of that line. If you want to send ideas for tags, just email
            me at <a href="mailto:hellofellowdogz@gmail.com">hellofellowdogz@gmail.com</a>.
