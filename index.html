            This is the website of a content creator, animator,
            programmer, architect, and more. My name is Lee
            Johnston, and I make videos for you to watch. When
            someone asks about my plans, chances are my reply is
            "Not much".
        </p>
        <p>My Plans:</p>
        <ul>
            <p>Making Spiral The Frog</p>
            <p class="nomar">Learning Godot</p>
            <p class="nomar">Making CCS</p>
        </ul>
        <p>I was born on the 12th of December, 2008 and live
